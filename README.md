# Introduction (About Me)
Welcome! This is my first big program written in Python and I absolutely love it.
A little bit about myself below,
My name is Julio, you can call me Jae which is what I go by, I was born in Cali, Colombia lived there until I was 5
and then moved to the United States of America lived in Miami for about a year and a half and then moved to New York City
and lived there till I was 11. Then my family and I decided to move down to Naples, Florida which at first was a small wealthy
retirement town and now its growing into a big city, tons of job growth. My next plan is to finish school, I graduated from 
Florida Southwestern State College with my AA and currently attend Lorenzo Walker Technical College. I'm learning how to program
in Python as well as Java, and on my own I plan to pick up HTML, CSS, Ruby, C and C++. After that I'm hoping to move
back to New York City and start my career in Software Engineering and learn tons of new languages as well as gain some
experience and just basically learn everything that I possibly can.
Any ways enough about me, lets move onto the Exotic Car Dealership I built.

## Car Dealership
This is an Exotic Online Car Dealership

### Exotic Car Dealership
This program consists of 10 total cars, some being exotic cars as well as a couple
standard vehicles you see on the road on day to day basis. This program will
basically tell the user that they have come across an Exotic Car Dealership and
will proceed to ask them if they would like to proceed, which prompts them yes or
no. If the user says no it'll end the program if they say yes it'll proceed to asking
them what the minimum they want to spend is and the maximum, then after that it'll
print out a list of cars in their price range and ask which they are interested in.
The user will type the car if there is a misspelling it will tell the user that's not
a choice and will end the program. If user types in the correct spelling then it proceeds
to printing out the specs of the car from top speed all the way to the color and price
and much more, the computer will ask the user if they would like to purchase if so yes
if not then no. If yes user will be congratulated on their new vehicle, if no then
user will be told thank you regardless and the computer will end the program.

HOPE YOU ENJOY THE PROGRAM.
